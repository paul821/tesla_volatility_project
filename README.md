# tesla_volatility_project

Summer 2023

First attempt at quant related, finance related project.

Started from my friend's acceptance into Tesla internship and his worries that Elon Musk going rampant on the web is going to cause him to lose his job.

Then Elon and Zuck were going to fight. They have a rivalry but is this for the shows or does Meta's performance negatively affect Tesla?

Went from GARCH -> LSTM and GARCH -> LSTM and cointegration -> LSTM and cointegration w/ GARCH and ARIMA

Enjoy.
